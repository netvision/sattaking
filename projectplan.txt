Need to develop a lottery app portal
prefarably in yii2, as backend api or you suggest? and frontend in vue3? 
i will host/deploy it on my already running ubuntu server with apache2/php
flow is like this:
    there will be two sections
    one is for public where results are shown as well as other info about the plateform. ui to browes archived results of earlier days linked to calender
    other is admin with password protected.
    admin would define the slots, title, their time when the result is announced and the result itself.
    result is any number between 0 to 99.
    few slots, as decided by the admin, must automatcally/randomly declare result at their decided time, if the admin has not already input the result.
    results, once declared and their time has elapsed can not be changed.
    all results are saved in database, mysql.
