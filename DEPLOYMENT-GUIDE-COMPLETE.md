# COMPLETE DEPLOYMENT GUIDE FOR FIXES

## Issues Fixed:
1. ✅ CORS issue with User Management API
2. ✅ Slots now work as daily recurring (set time once, runs every day)

## Files to Upload:

### 1. New User Management API Controller
- Upload: `controllers/UserController.php`
- Purpose: Web API for user management with proper CORS

### 2. Updated Configuration
- Upload: `config/web.php`
- Purpose: Added user management routes

### 3. Updated Slot Model & Migration
- Upload: `models/Slot.php`
- Upload: `migrations/m240816_000004_modify_slots_for_daily_recurring.php`
- Purpose: Slots now store time only (HH:MM:SS) and run daily

### 4. Updated Controllers
- Upload: `controllers/SlotController.php`
- Upload: `commands/ResultController.php`
- Purpose: Work with new daily recurring slot system

## Deployment Steps:

### Step 1: Upload Files
```powershell
# Upload all updated files
scp controllers/UserController.php your-server:/path/to/api/controllers/
scp config/web.php your-server:/path/to/api/config/
scp models/Slot.php your-server:/path/to/api/models/
scp controllers/SlotController.php your-server:/path/to/api/controllers/
scp commands/ResultController.php your-server:/path/to/api/commands/
scp migrations/m240816_000004_modify_slots_for_daily_recurring.php your-server:/path/to/api/migrations/
```

### Step 2: Run Migration
```bash
# SSH into server and run:
cd /path/to/your/api
php yii migrate/up
```

### Step 3: Update Existing Slots (if any)
```bash
# Convert existing slot times to time format
# Example: If you have slots with full datetime, update them:
# UPDATE slots SET scheduled_time = TIME(scheduled_time);
```

### Step 4: Restart Web Server
```bash
sudo systemctl restart apache2
# OR
sudo systemctl restart nginx && sudo systemctl restart php-fpm
```

## How It Works Now:

### User Management API:
- ✅ GET /users - List all users
- ✅ POST /users - Create user
- ✅ PUT /users/{id} - Update user
- ✅ DELETE /users/{id} - Soft delete user
- ✅ POST /users/{id}/toggle-status - Toggle active/inactive
- ✅ GET /users/{id} - View user details

### Daily Recurring Slots:
- ✅ Slots store only time (e.g., "14:30:00")
- ✅ They automatically run every day at that time
- ✅ No need to set date - just the time
- ✅ Results are still dated per day
- ✅ Auto-generation works based on current time matching slot time

### Example Slot Creation:
```json
{
  "title": "Afternoon Draw",
  "scheduled_time": "14:30:00",
  "is_auto": 1,
  "is_active": 1,
  "description": "Daily afternoon lottery draw"
}
```

This slot will now run every day at 2:30 PM!

## Testing:

### Test User Management:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" https://api.sattaking.app/users
```

### Test Slots:
```bash
curl https://api.sattaking.app/slots/today
```

### Verify Auto-Generation:
```bash
# Run manually to test
php yii result/auto-generate
```

## Notes:
- Old slots with full datetime will be converted to time-only format
- The system is now much more efficient for daily recurring operations
- CORS is properly configured for user management
- All existing functionality preserved, just enhanced!
